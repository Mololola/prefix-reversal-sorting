# 🧠 Prefix Reversal Sorting (COMP526 – Efficient Algorithms)

This repository contains the implementation and testing of **Prefix Reversal Sorting** algorithms — also known as the *Pancake Sorting Problem* — developed as part of **Programming Assignment 1** for the module **COMP526: Efficient Algorithms (Fall 2024)** at the University of Liverpool.

The goal of this project is to design and implement efficient algorithms that sort integer arrays using **only prefix reversals**, optimizing both **correctness** and **minimal reversal cost**.

## 📚 Project Overview

### 🧩 What Is Prefix Reversal Sorting?

A **prefix reversal** (or "flip") at index *i* reverses the order of all elements up to that index.  
For example:
